# Optimization-Analyses---MSc
Codes for Optimization Analyses for Green Spaces Prioritazation developed during my master's degree

This repository contains R and Python scripts developed for the analyses conducted during my master's degree. 
I applied optimization analyses based on linear programming algorithms to prioritize green spaces (urban parks) implementation in a Brazilian megacity.
These scripts presents the optimization model and generate visualizations (graphs) of the analysis results.
